This python application will convert LaTeX (math-mode) code to a png image file.
It depends on the ImageTk package (not included in standard python distribution). Other python dependencies (os, Tkinter) are included in a standard python distribution, so the user need not worry about these.

System requirements: linux operating system
Package requirements: dvipng, python, latex

Please note: The application will crop your text appropriately, but cannot handle more than 1 page. However its primary limitation is the platform dependence: the 'latex' command works in linux, but not windows. It also depends on the dvipng package (only available for linux) to convert the .dvi file to a .png file.

Extra info for latex experts: 
The application takes input from the user via a text box. The input is already enclosed by math-mode tags, and includes {amsmath,amssymb,amsthm} in the preamble. To move to a new line, use '\\'.
